    # cert-manager will put the resulting Secret in the same Kubernetes namespace
    # as the Certificate. Therefore you should put this Certificate in the same namespace as Ambassador.
    # eg. if you deploy ambassador to ambassador namespace, you need to change to namespace: ambassador
    namespace: default
  spec:
    # naming the secret name certificate ambassador-certs is important because
    # ambassador just look for this particular name
